# React Days Fall 2023 - SRR in React hands-on exercises

This repository provides starters for the three presented Frameworks ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)) in order to create
a microblog using SSR techniques. Pick the framework that interests you most and try to solve the tasks outlined in the individual framework folders' README.md.

## Repository Layout
The `backend` folder contains a `json-server` based backend acting as a shared CRUD API for managing Post objects for your microblog. To run the server:

```
cd backend
npm install
npm run backend
```

The framework folders `nextjs`, `remix` and `gatsby` contain starter setups for each of the respective frameworks.
Some of the starters include some prepared code or components to help you get started without worrying too much about
things not related directly to the SSR setups.

For more details refer to the individual README files within echo of the framework folders.
